I am a current Ph.D Candidate in Astrophysics at West Virginia University. My research focuses on Radio Astronomy, specifically the neutral hydrogen content of galaxies and how this is affected by the large-scale structure of the universe. 

I work with the COSMOS HIN Large Extragalactic Survey (CHILES) in developing pipelines for calibration and imaging as well as studying the HI content of galaxies as a function of large-scale structure across cosmic time. Additionally, I am involved with the Local Volumes TiNy-Titans and GAs Stripping Phenomenon in Galaxies collaborations.
